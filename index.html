            CUET PG 2023: The National Testing Agency (NTA) Thursday released a corrigendum for the Common University Entrance Test (CUET-PG) 2023 examination. Candidates will be able to check the changes at the official website — cuet.nta.nic.in.
            According to this corrigendum, the English and Foreign Languages University will accept CUET PG score as an eligibility criteria for its postgraduate programmes. “The English and Foreign Languages University had earlier withdrawn from CUET (PG)-2023 at the last moment due to which the name of the University is not reflected in the list of participating Universities. However, the courses offered by the University are visible in the bunching list. Now the University has again joined CUET (PG)-2023 and the candidates can apply for the same,” the official notice stated.

        <div class="time">Bengaluru | Updated: April 1, 2023 07:50 IST</div>
        <div class="content">
            Senior BJP leader and former Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa, who has been engaged in a tacit battle with the BJP central leadership over the political future of his younger son B Y Vijayendra, announced on Friday that his son is in contention only from the family pocket borough of Shikaripura.

            The announcement by Yediyurappa came amid charges by the opposition Congress that the former BJP CM was being “blackmailed” into fielding his son from Varuna seat in the Mysuru region – which has been long held by Congress stalwart Siddaramaiah. The Congress alleged that the BJP wanted to make Yediyurappa’s son a “sacrificial lamb”.
